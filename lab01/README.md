# About Dataset

This data set has been generated using data from the Gapminder website, which focuses on gathering and sharing statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels.

This particular data set describes the values of several parameters (see the list below) between 1998 and 2018 for a total of 175 countries, having a total of 3675 rows. The parameters included in the data set and the column name of the dataframe are as follows:

1. Country (country). Describes the country name

2. Continent (continent). Describes the continent to which the country belongs

3. Year (year). Describes the year to which the data belongs

4. Life expectancy (life_exp). Describes the life expectancy for a given country in a given year

5. Human Development Index (hdi_index). Describes the HDI index value for a given country in a given year

6. CO2 emissions per person(co2_consump). Describes the CO2 emissions in tonnes per person for a given country in a given year

7. Gross Domestic Product per capita (gdp). Describes the GDP per capita in dollars for a given country in a given year

8. % Service workers (services). Describes the the % of service workers for a given country in a given year


## Developing a Research Question
I have lived in several different countries while working in international development. I am also very interested in technology and how it can affect our lives. Therefore, I began to explore the GapMinder dataset (gapminder.csv) as it was created to investigate development goals. In particular, I want to explore how internet penetration can affect the quality of professional life in a country.

An initial relationship I want to look at is how a country's polityscore, a measure of a country's democratic and free nature, is affected by its internet use rate. But I think secondary questions of interest would be how the polity score is correlated with the overall employment rate and also the female employment rate, as a proxy for progressive views in the workplace. Additionally, the income per person could be an interesting aspect to this exploration.

A search of Google Scholar for the phrase “polity score and internet penetration” reveals more than 19,000 links. The articles all seem to agree that greater access to the internet is a boost to democratic institutions. For instance, a report by the International Communication Gazette presents their own research findings that increased internet diffusion is a meaningful predictor of more democratic regimes. The Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society finds that while internet usage from 1992 until 2000 was not a powerful predictor of democratic tendencies in a country, internet usage from 2001 and 2002 was very strongly correlated. Lastly, The Journal of Communication, found it was not internet penetration in a country which could predict the polity score, but specifically internet use.

Based on this research, my hypothesis is that internet usage and polity score will be strongly positively correlated. I also suspect that high high employment and female employment rates, as well as a high income per person, will be linked to a country's polity score.
