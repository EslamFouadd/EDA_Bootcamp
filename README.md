Learn SAS or Python programming, expand your knowledge of analytical methods and applications, and conduct original research to inform complex decisions.
The Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization takes you from data novice to data expert in just four project-based courses. You will apply basic data science tools, including data management and visualization, modeling, and machine learning using your choice of either SAS or Python, including pandas and Scikit-learn. Throughout the Specialization, you will analyze a research question of your choice and summarize your insights. In the Capstone Project, you will use real data to address an important issue in society, and report your findings in a professional-quality report. You will have the opportunity to work with our industry partners, DRIVENDATA and The Connection. Help DRIVENDATA solve some of the world's biggest social challenges by joining one of their competitions, or help The Connection better understand recidivism risk for people on parole in substance use treatment. Regular feedback from peers will provide you a chance to reshape your question. This Specialization is designed to help you whether you are considering a career in data, work in a context where supervisors are looking to you for data insights, or you just have some burning questions you want to explore. No prior experience is required. By the end you will have mastered statistical methods to conduct original research to inform complex decisions.

### SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN

Statistics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Regression Analysis, SAS Language, Python Programming, Data Management, Chi-Squared (Chi-2) Distribution, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA), Logistic, Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis

[AVAILABLE CODE BOOKS AND DATA SETS]

Here are codebooks (as pdf files) and data sets (as .csv files) for each of five data sets that are used throughout the data analysis fundamentals specialization.
[1. The U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/NESARC Wave 1 Code Book w toc.pdf) is a survey designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders in the U.S. population. It is a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population 18 years and older.

[2. The Mars Craters Study](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/Mars Crater Codebook.pdf), presents a global database that includes over 300,000 Mars craters 1 km or larger that were created between 4.2 and 3.8 billion years ago during a period of heavy bombardment (i.e. impacts of asteroids, proto-planets, and comets).

[3. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/AddHealth Wave 1 Codebooks.zip) is a representative school-based survey of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States. The Wave 1 survey focuses on factors that may influence adolescentsâ€™ health and risk behaviors, including personal traits, families, friendships, romantic relationships, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. Check out the AddHealth Code Book Index to see a list of the topics addressed in each codebook section.

[5. The Outlook on Life Survey (OOL)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/data-management-visualization/OutlookOnLife Codebook.pdf) was designed to study political and social attitudes in the United States. The project included two surveys fielded between August and December 2012 using a sample from an Internet panel. The target population was comprised of four groups: African American/Black males aged 18 and older, African American/Black females aged 18 and older, White/other race males aged 18 and older, and White/other race females aged 18 older

The OLL data have been generously made available to us by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). These data are restricted to download and use only during this Coursera specialization. OOL files should be deleted following the completion of the capstone experience or at the end of the last assignment that you choose to complete. Data files for this survey should not be shared or re-posted at any time. Your use of this data set indicates your acceptance of these terms. Details on ICPSR membership and full access to their data archive is available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/membership/index.html.
